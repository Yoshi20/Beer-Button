    title1: "What's it about?"
    text11: "The BeerButton pilot project is an initiative that aims to optimize the ordering and/or service experience in restaurants and increase sales without having to bear high initial investment costs."
    text12: "The BeerButtons themselves are battery-powered devices with buttons and an e-paper display that is capable of displaying any 200x200 pixel image."
    text13: "For example, this could be individual products, a bell or a company logo:"
    title2: "How much does the fun cost?"
    text21: "As part of the \"Hardware-as-a-Service\" concept, we provide the BeerButtons and the gateway <strong>free</strong> of charge."
    text22: "The cost of the service then corresponds to approximately one large beer per device, namely CHF 7.- per month or CHF 84.- per year."
    title3: "Profit Estimation"
    text31: "We estimate that each device leads to an additional order on average once a week. For a large beer at 7.- each, that would be around 350.- more in sales per year. With 20 tables, that would correspond to 7000.- francs."
    text32: "A BeerButton, on the other hand, only costs 84.- per year. With 20 tables that would be 1680.- francs."
    text33: "The result is a positive difference of over 5300.- per year."
    title4: "Application possibilities"
    text41: "In addition to the catchphrase: \"Ordering a beer directly to the table\", the BeerButton can be used in a variety of ways."
    text42: "For example, as a virtual \"bell\" to call the waiter/waitress to the table, or to signal an empty paper towel dispenser in the toilet, etc."
    title5: "Requirements"
    text51: "- 1 computer, tablet or smartphone with internet access"
    text52: "- 10 or more possible uses (e.g. tables)"
    text56: "- 1 power socket for the LoRa gateway"
    text57: "- 1 network socket (or WLAN) for the LoRa gateway"
    text58: "- The willingness to try something new ðŸ™‚"
    title6: "How can I take part in the pilot?"
    text61: "Click on"
    text62: "to create a login. An employee will then be informed, who will then contact you."
    title7: "FAQs"
    text71: "Can any image be used?"
    text72: "-> Yes, but for order applications that lead to a purchase, the price must also be shown"
    text73: "How does the image get on the button?"
    text74: "-> By an employee (via Bluetooth and smartphone app)"
    text75: "What kind of battery does the button use?"
    text76: "-> CR2430 button battery (lasts 1-3 years depending on handling)"
    text77: "I lost a BeerButton, what now?"
    text78: "-> If hardware is defective, lost or stolen, it must be replaced at the replacement price"
    text79: "How are the two buttons different?"
    text710: "-> A different event can be triggered per button"
